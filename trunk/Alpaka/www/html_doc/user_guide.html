<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>This is a first attempt to write a small guide to the Alpaka
framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alpaka is basically a tool to help in the development of MVC web
applications. Is a lightweight framework, and one of their objectives
is not to be bloated. With Alpaka you can organize your work in
Applications, Dispatchers and Actions. Actions are simply
methods, Dispachers are classes groupping&nbsp;actions, and
Applications are classes groupping Dispatchers. The URL's are mapped to
this
hierarchy, so, a common URL will looks like:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">http://host/app/dispacher/action.do</pre>
<p>But, to maintain the url schema flexible, the dispatcher can use
more
than one path element, i.e.:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">http://host/app/dis/patcher/action.do</pre>
<p>And the application can be mapped to /, if you only have one
application per host, i.e.:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">http://host/dispatcher/action.do</pre>
<p>A more clear example:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">http://www.mywebsite.com/user/edit.do</pre>
<p>Here, you are executing the 'edit' action from the dispatcher
associated with the 'user' path
from the application associated to '/'. You will see more on how urls
are mapped to
their correspondent dispatcher, later.</p>
<h2>Configuring </h2>
<p>To configure an alpaka application to run under mod_perl you have
to add the following to the Apache configuration:</p>
<pre>PerlModule MySite<br>&lt;Location /&gt;<br>    SetHandler perl-script<br>    PerlResponseHandler MySite-&gt;mp2_handler<br>&lt;/Location&gt; <br><br></pre>
<p>In case you're using mod_perl1 you should use the mp1_handler. (You
can also run an alpaka application under CGI, using the cgi_handler).</p>
<p>All the clases created should be accesible by mod_perl, so you
should put the directory where you put your classes in the include
path. There is more than one way to do it. I.E. you can add to the
startup.pl script:</p>
<pre>use lib qw( /path/to/your/lib );</pre>
<h2>The Application Class</h2>
<p>As you can see, the application is represented by the MySite
module (class), so, to begin the development, we first need to create
an Application Class called MySite (in this example). Inside the
application, dispatcher are configured, and they will be the
responsible of executing the actions requested in the url.</p>
<p>Basically an Application Class looks like following:</p>
<pre>package MySite;<br>use strict;<br> <br>use base 'Alpaka::Application';<br> <br>sub init {<br>    my $self = shift;<br> <br>    $self-&gt;map( <br>       '_default'  =&gt; 'MySite::Index', <br>       'news'      =&gt; 'MySite::News',<br>    );<br>}<br><br>1;</pre>
<p>This is the minimal you need to create a new application (and most
of
the time, that's all you need). What you are doing here, is to
override the init method inherited from Alpaka::Application to set up
the
mapping between urls and
dispatchers classes. We choose this explicit way over an automatic
mapping, to
gain flexibility, and control at expenses of doing a little more of
work.</p>
<h2>The Dispatchers</h2>
<p>Supposed you're mapping the application to /, the url:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">http://host/news/action.do</pre>
<p>is handled by the Dispatcher Class MySite::News. In the same way,
the url:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">http://host</pre>
<p>is handled by the MySite::Index class, because it is the default
dispatcher (when no other dispatcher is specified).</p>
<p>To follow the development of our application, we need to create
the dispatchers. A Dispatcher class looks like follows:</p>
<pre>package MySite::News;<br>use strict;<br>  <br>use base 'Alpaka::Dispatcher';<br><br>sub show : action {<br>    my ($self, $request, $response, $session, $app) = @_;<br>   <br>    $response-&gt;write('&lt;h1&gt;Hello World, this is my first news.&lt;/h1&gt;');<br>    <br>}<br><br>1;</pre>
<h2>The Actions</h2>
<p>The actions are simply methods inside a dispatcher class. We call
them 'action&nbsp;methods'. This Dispatcher class contains one action
(the show method) which is marked as action using a subroutine
attribute. Inside dispatcher classes, only methods with the action
attribute are actually actions, and can be called from url requests,
so is safe to add any other methods to &nbsp;the class because
only&nbsp;can be executed from outside if you explicitly declare as
actions.</p>
<p>So we can now request the folowing URL:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">http://host/news/show.do</pre>
<p>and the hello world message will appear in your browser.</p>
<p>A dispatcher class can contain any number of actions, is you
responsibility to group actions in Dispatcher classes to match you
business logic, and keep the application maintainable an manageable.</p>
<h2>The Request and Response Objects</h2>
<p>In every action, the current dispatcher ($self), the request
object (from where you can get GET/POST parameters), the response
object (to which you can write to), the session object (where you can
set/get session data), and the application object, are passed as
parameters (always, in that order).</p>
<p>As you can see you can write to the $response object to generate
your output. But, in a "real world" application you won't
be calling $response-&gt;write to generate the output, you may be
using a template system. Alpaka makes no assumption of which template
system do you prefer. You can use your template system of choice in the
same way you use it in any other mod_perl o cgi application. (Did I
mention you don't have to worry if the application runs under modperl
or cgi?). &nbsp;If available, you can use a template system plugin,
like the Alpaka::Plugin::TT2 plugin for Template::Toolkit 2</p>
<p>Most of the time you may&nbsp;only need the first 3, so you can
just write:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">my ($self, $request, $response) = @_</pre>
<p>And of course you can choose the name of the parameters, i.e.:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">my ($self, $req, $resp) = @_</pre>
<p>As example, we can introduce a GET parameter: </p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">http://host/news/show.do?name=Jhon</pre>
<p>And the action method would looks like:</p>
<pre>sub show : action {<br>    my ($self, $request, $response, $session, $app) = @_;<br>   <br>    my $name = $request-&gt;get('name');<br>    $response-&gt;write("&lt;h1&gt;Hello $name, this is my first news.&lt;/h1&gt;");<br>    <br>}</pre>
<p>To start with Alpaka, this are the most important things you need to
know. Now you can read the Application, Dispatcher, Request, Response
and Session docs, to see how to get GET/POST parameters, do redirects
and forwards (between actions), and store data in the session.&nbsp; </p>
