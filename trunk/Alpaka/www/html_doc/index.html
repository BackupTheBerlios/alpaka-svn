<h2>Introduction
</h2>
<p class="para">Alpaka is a MVC
(Model/View/Controller) framework for building web applications. It's
on very alfa stage. You shouldn't use this module on production
environments (probably, you can't, anyway). This, is a "quick &amp;
dirty" (very quick and very dirty) introduction. </p>
<p class="para">Alpaka is yet another MVC framework for web
applications. It's made to be flexible, agile, non intrusive, and of
course, perlish. So, with Alpaka "There's more than one
way to do it" and "Easy things should be easy and difficult
things should be possible". </p>
<p class="para">Actually, Alpaka is the
"Controller" part of MVC, you can use several "Views"
like Template Toolkit or HTML::Template, and you are neither
restricted in the "Model" part. You can use plain old perl
objects, something like Class::DBI, etc.</p>
<p class="para">Alpaka comes with a very simple plug-in system, so, new
functionality can be added to the framework to maintain&nbsp; the core
small and compact. </p>
<p class="para">Alpaka structures the control of
a web application in "Applications", "Dispatchers"
and "Actions". An Application has Dispatchers, and Dispatchers has
Actions. The URLs are in the form of
http://host/application/dispatcher/action.do or
http://host/dispatcher/action.do
</p>
<p class="para">If you are looking for a more
stable MVC framework based on perl, check out <a
